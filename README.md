I've created a simple cryptocurrency tracking web application using React.js and CoinCap API. This application provides users with data into cryptocurrency prices, market caps and trading volumes.

Technologies Used:
- React.js
- CoinCap API: https://docs.coincap.io/
- HTML/CSS
- Local Storage
- Axios for API integration
- Netlify for deployment

Features:
- User-friendly interface allowing users to add, edit, and remove cryptocurrencies from their portfolio.
- Data integration from the CoinCap API, enabling live calculations of portfolio values.
- Seamless search functionality for easy navigation through cryptocurrency data.
- Local storage implementation for data persistence across user sessions.

Project Structure:
- src folder contains the React.js components and logic for the front end.
- API integration using Axios for real-time data updates.
- Implementation of local storage to maintain user portfolios.
- Deployment on Netlify for accessibility.
